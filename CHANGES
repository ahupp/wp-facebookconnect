= 1.3.0 -> 2.0.0 =
 - Upgraded to the new Facebook PHP SDK. The most noticeable change from
   an administrator standpoint is that it requires the App ID instead of
   API Key. If all goes well, this should be fetched on the first page
   load after upgrade. If not, the plugin will continue to try again
   every hour until it succeeds. It will also attempt to fetch the App ID
   on every visit to the plugin's settings page. 

= 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0 =

 - Add a "Like" button to posts
 - No longer set user_email because it no longer works, and overwrites
   user-entered addresses

= 1.1.2 -> 1.2.0 =

 - Template bundles have been replaced with the stream.publish API.
   Any template customizations will need to be updated for this API.
